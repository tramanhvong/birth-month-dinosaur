triceratops,"Triceratops means ‘three horned face’ in Greek. These horns are thought to have been used for dueling, in a similar way to how stags duel with their antlers. The giant neck frill, meanwhile, was a source of protection."
triceratops,"Triceratops was discovered in 1887: When the first triceratops specimen was discovered, way back in 1887, it was mistakenly thought to be an extinct species of bison. It was only later that it was found to be a horned dinosaur. The American palaeontologist, O.C. Marsh was first to name and describe it."
triceratops,"Triceratops was one of the last non-flying dinosaurs to have evolved, being part of the Late Cretaceous Period (145.5 million to 65 million years ago). Triceratops was walking the earth when the dinosaurs were wiped out."
triceratops,"Triceratops was formidable: It was a big dinosaur, stretching up to nine metres in length – that’s slightly longer than a bus! It weighed in at six to eight tons, and had an enormous head. Some skulls have been found measuring up to three metres long, but this wasn’t always able to deter the hungry T-rex; bite marks have been found in some specimens, including one fossil where a horn had been bitten clean off."
triceratops,"Triceratops’ horns changed as it grew: Young triceratops had small, straight horns above its eyes. As it grew, the horns became backward-curving, and then finally, when it reached adulthood, the horns curved forward. As for the horn on its nose, this was made of keratin, which is the same substance that human fingernails and rhino horns are made of."
triceratops,"Triceratops had a bird-like beak that helped it clip through the tough vegetation that formed part of its diet. It also had several hundred teeth in its jaws, which ground the food down. As one set of teeth wore down from the constant chewing, they were replaced by a new set."
